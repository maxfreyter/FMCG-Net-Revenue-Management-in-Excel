Analyzed FMCG data to optimize pricing, product mix, and promotional strategies, enhancing net revenue management. Tracked sales and market performance by analyzing KPIs. Calculated yearly growth, month-to-month, YTD and MAT.  

## Project Overview



  In today’s ultra-competitive FMCG arena, data-driven insights are the secret weapon behind the success of iconic brands like Coca-Cola, Nivea, and Lay’s. This project harnesses the power of advanced Excel analytics to transform raw market data into actionable, high-impact business strategies for HealthMax, a market leader in the shampoo industry. By combining rigorous data analysis with strategic forecasting, this project illuminates pathways to superior revenue growth and profitability.



## Data Analysis & Methodology
